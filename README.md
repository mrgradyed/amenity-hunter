## About Overpass API
"The Overpass API (or OSM3S) is a read-only API that serves up custom selected parts of the OSM map data. It acts as a database over the web: the client sends a query to the API and gets back the data set that corresponds to the query.
Unlike the main API, which is optimized for editing, Overpass API is optimized for data consumers that need a few elements within a glimpse or up to roughly 100 million elements in some minutes, both selected by search criteria like e.g. location, type of objects, tag properties, proximity, or combinations of them."
